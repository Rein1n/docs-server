= WND Configuration Quick Guide

== Introduction

This is a quick guide for installing and configuring the Windows Network Drive (WND) app.

== Prerequisites

To successfully use the Windows Network Drive app, you must meet the prerequisites which can be found in the xref:installation/manual_installation/server_prep_ubuntu_20.04.adoc[Server Preparation for Ubuntu 20.04]. In particular, these are the sections required which address `smbclient` (
xref:installation/manual_installation/server_prep_ubuntu_20.04.adoc#clean-ubuntu-20-04-installation[Clean Ubuntu 20.04 Installation]) and `libsmbclient-php` (
xref:installation/manual_installation/server_prep_ubuntu_20.04.adoc#libsmbclient-php-library[libsmbclient-php Library]).

== Installation

Install the WND app either via the Web Interface or the command line:

WebUI::
* The Windows Network Drive app has to be downloaded from the Market App. Navigate to the Market app, search for Windows Network Drive and install it.
* Post installing enable it via menu:Settings[Admin > Apps].

Command line::
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} market:install windows_network_drive
----

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable windows_network_drive
----

== Configuration

**WebUI**

Enable external shares:

* Navigate to menu:Settings[Admin > Storage]
* Enable the external storage
* Create a new share and choose Windows network Drives

Configure external share:

* Folder Name: A name for the WND Share
* Authentication: Choose **Log-in credentials, save in database**
* Host: domain name or IP address
* Share: name of the top share
* Remote Subfolder: enter `$user` for every user to get a home drive
* Permission Manager: leave empty to use the default one
* Domain: domain name of your server
* Available for: limit access to groups
* Settings: (gear wheel) enable the options you need


IMPORTANT: If you plan to use ownCloud **only** in the Web Browser - your setup of the WND is complete.

If you plan to use a desktop client, you need to continue and configure the WND listener and WND process queue.

**Commandline**

Lastly, you need to setup the wnd listener and process queue to propagate the changes made directly on the storage of your share to the sync client.

This can be done in 2 ways:

* you configure a new systemd service for the listener and setup a process queue cron job
* you setup a cronjob for the wnd:listen command and process queue cron job

=== WND Listener Configuration

Create a service for systemd following the instructions below that checks the share for changes:

* For each WND mount point distinguished by a SERVER - SHARE pair:
** Replace the all upper case words `SERVER`, `SHARE`, `USER` and `PASSWORD` in both, the **filename** and in the **contents** below with their respective values.
** Place one copy of a file with the content from below under `/etc/systemd/system/owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service` +
To do so, enter the following command and replace <name> with `owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE`. For more details see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units#editing-unit-files[Editing Unit Files]:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl edit --force --full <name>.service
----
+
Reload the deamon to make it available:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
----
** Take care to also adjust the paths in `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` according to your installation.
** Password: Create a file readable only by the www-data user and outside the directories handled by Apache
 (let's suppose in /tmp/mypass). The file must contain only the password for the share. In this example our
 file is: "/tmp/mypass". The listener will read the contents of the file and use them as the password for
the account. This way, only root and the Apache user should have access to the password.
** `--password-trim` in directive `ExecStart` removes blank characters from the password file added by 3rdparty software or other services.

+
[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl enable owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service
sudo systemctl start  owncloud-wnd-listen-SERVER-SHARE.service
----

=== WND Process Queue Configuration

Create or add a `crontab` file in `/etc/cron.d/oc-wnd-process-queue`.

* Make a `crontab` entry to run a script iterating over all `SERVER SHARE` pairs with an
  appropriate `occ wnd:process-queue` command. The commands must be **strictly sequential**. 
  This can be done by using `flock -n` and tuning the `-c` parameter of `occ wnd:process-queue`

[source,bash]
----
* * * * *  sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/php /var/www/owncloud/occ wnd:process-queue <HOST> <SHARE>
----

==== Execution Serialization

Parallel runs of `wnd:process-queue` might lead to a user lockout. The reason for this, is that several
`wnd:process-queue` might use the same wrong password because it hasn’t been updated by the time they
fetch it.

It’s recommended to force the execution serialization of the `wnd:process-queue` command. You might want to
use Anacron, which seems to have an option for this scenario, or wrap the command with flock.

If you need to serialize the execution of the wnd:process-queue, check the following example with flock

[source,bash]
----
* * * * * flock -n /tmp/wnd001 occ wnd:process-queue server1 share1
* * * * * flock -n /tmp/wnd002 occ wnd:process-queue server1 share2
* * * * * flock -n /tmp/wnd003 occ wnd:process-queue server2 share3
----

== Troubleshooting

* The process queue will not work if there is a backslash in the share path configured in webui.
* The process queue will not work if the share name in the webui is configured starting with a forward slash `/`.

If you encounter issues using Windows network drive, then try the following troubleshooting steps:

Check the connection to the share by using smbclient on the command line of the ownCloud server.
Here is an example:

[source,bash]
----
smbclient -U Username -L //Servername
----

Take the example of attempting to connect to the share named MyData using occ wnd:listen.
Running the following command would work:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} wnd:listen MyHost MyData svc_owncloud password
----

The command is case-sensitive, and it must match the information from the mount point configuration.

* When the output of the `occ process-queue ..` command shows `0 Storages found`, then this means,
    that there was no corresponding external storage configuration found, because:
    1. The casing between calling the process queue and the web interface does not exactly match. 
    2. The authentication method is not correctly configured, it needs to be **Log-in credentials, save in database**
